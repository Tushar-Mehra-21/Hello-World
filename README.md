The start of my git journey

My name is Tushar , Tushar mehra. I am interested in developement though I haven't done much because i just started coding in college.
My skills are java , oops, dsa. I have 5 stars in java, 5 stars in C and 3 stars in DSA on hackerRanks. This is my first time creating a branch.
